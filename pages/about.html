        <h1>Hi, I'm Michael Kerr</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
                I'm a 20-something year old looking to change careers and learn Web Design and Development.
                From a small town in Michigan I grew up with a love for technology and video games.
                As I got older I realized that I could make a career out of my passions, after flip flopping majors and jobs I've decided to put down the spatula and pick up the keyboard!
                I may end up going back to school for a Computer Science degree, but time and money will tell.
        </p>
