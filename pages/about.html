                                <p>
                                        I'm a 20-something year old looking to change careers and learn Web Design and Development.
                                        From a small town in Michigan I grew up with a love for technology and video games.
                                        As I got older I realized that I could make a career out of my passions, after flip flopping majors and jobs I've decided to put down the spatula and pick up the keyboard!
                                        I may end up going back to school for a Computer Science degree, but time and money will tell.
                                </p>

                                        A text-based adventure game that I made in C#.
                                        It's a simple game that I made to learn the basics of programming and to have a little fun.
                                        I've uploaded the source code to my GitHub, <em><strong>click the image</strong></em> to check it out!
